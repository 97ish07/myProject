        Through the 1940s Wickramasinghe dabbled with the double role of literary critic and creative
         writer. Gamperaliya (1944) is widely held as the first Sinhalese novel with a serious intent
          that compares, in content and technique, with the great novels of modern world literature.
           The novel depicts the crumbling of traditional village life under the pressure of modernisation.
            The story of a successful family in a Southern village is used to portray the gradual 
            replacement of traditional economic and social structure of the village by commercial
             city influence.[3][5]
        
        Wickramasinghe followed Gamperaliya with Yuganthaya (1948) and Kaliyugaya (1957) forming 
        a trilogy. After the decay of the traditional life, the story details the rise of the bourgeoisie,
         with its urban base and entrepreneurial drive, ending with the formation of the labour movement and 
         socialist theology and rise of hopes for a new social order. The trilogy was made into film by the
          renowned Sri Lankan director Dr. Lester James Peries.[4][8]
        
        With the development of a literary criticism movement in the early-'50s, Wickramasinghe presented
         the works Sahitya Kalava ('The Art of Literature' 1950) and Kawya Vicharaya ('The Criticism of Poetry' 
         1954). He received an MBE around this time.[8]
        
        Wickramasinghe's most heralded work came in 1956 with Viragaya. Due to the significance of its theme and
         the sophistication of its technique, the novel has come to be hailed as the greatest work of Sinhalese fiction.
          It follows the spiritual problems of a fragile Sinhalese youth raised in a traditional Buddhist home after being
           confronted with the spectre of adulthood and the responsibilities that come with it all made more complex with
            the modernisation of society. First-person narrative is used to put forth the autobiographical story of the 
            anti-hero in impressionistic vignettes rather than in chronological order. It is a seminal work and spawned a
             spew of imitators, some good on their own right.[2]</p>
